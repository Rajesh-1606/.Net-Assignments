<H2>Inventory Management System</H2>
The Inventory Management System is a console-based application developed in C#. It aims to help users manage a collection of items efficiently by leveraging Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles, functions, arrays, lists, and CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. This project showcases the use of encapsulation, inheritance, and other key OOP concepts in a practical scenario.
<H2>Key Concepts</H2>
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): The project is designed using OOP principles to ensure modularity, reusability, and maintainability.</br>
Encapsulation: Properties and methods are encapsulated within classes.</br>
Inheritance: While not explicitly required, the project is designed to be easily extendable with inheritance if needed.</br>
CRUD Operations: The system allows for creating, reading, updating, and deleting items in the inventory.</br>
Lists: A list is used to store and manage the collection of items dynamically.</br>
Input Validation: Ensures that user inputs are validated to handle edge cases and prevent errors.</br>

Upon running the application, the user will be presented with a menu to perform various operations on the inventory:
